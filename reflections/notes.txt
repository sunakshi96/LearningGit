GIT ERRORS AND WARNINGS
-----------------------
Should not be doing an octopus::Octopus is a strategy that Git uses to combine different versions of code together. This message can be used if you use this strategy in an inappropriate condition.

You are in a 'detached head state'::
HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can "detach" the HEAD by switching to a previous commit. Despite of what it sounds like, it is not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you ll realize what you are doing it.

Panic! The impossible happened::
This is a real error message, but it is not the output of GIT. Instead it is the output of GHC, the compiler for a programming language called Haskell. It is reserved for particularly surprising errors!
