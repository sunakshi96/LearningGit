Properties of Version Control Systems
-------------------------------------
1.) ANY EDITOR::
Manual Saving : Yes we can as we operate the code manually on editors.
Dropbox: Though dropbox do not provide the syntax highlighters but does uses editors
Wikipedia: Not designed for any code hence do not use editors.
Google Docs: Not designed for any code hence do not use editors, 
-------------------------------------

2.) USE OFFLINE:
Manual Saving:Manual saving is the only option that we can use offline.
Dropbox: Here we can edit the files on the computer but we cannot see the history online.
Google Docs: It works only for the special purpose editors and we can access the history of the files
Wikipedia:Does not save any file on our computer so cant be used offline

3.) MANUAL SAVING
Manual Saving: Manual Saving clearly requires us to manually save
Wikipedia:Also requires this 
Dropbox and Google Docs: Save versions for us whether or not we manually save.
Git: it uses manual save allowing users to create manual checkpoints.Each and every version in Git reflects as a logical change
=========================================================================
COMMITS::
Commits are the user created building blocks of git!Each one representing the version of the content at one point in time.
Git requires to suply commit message each time the commmit is created.
-fix off by-one bug
-add cool new features
-improve user docs
=========================================================================

As a programmer when would you want to have a version of your code saved?
Option1:)At regular intervals of time?
Option2:)Whenever there a large enough change is made(50 hours)
Option3:)Whenever there is long pause in the editing
Option4:)When you choose to save a version.

Answer(Sarah's (instructor) thoughts)
Option 1:Here it looks not logical since it might be possible that some of the lines get edited in between the new checkpoint started. It might give a granular result but since it is the only reason, so it is not a better option

Option2:)It just like the above case, we might want to change only 3 lines and then leave it for a week, waiting for 50 lines and then save it might not occur in the entire process of maintenance. So it is also not a good option.

Option 3:) It does sound promising, since it saves the changes only when there are enough changes to be saved.

Optiin4:)Flexible but has a downside too!
